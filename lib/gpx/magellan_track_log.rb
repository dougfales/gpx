module GPX

   # This class will parse the lat/lon and time data from a Magellan track log,
   # which is a NMEA formatted CSV list of points.

      #PMGNTRK
      # This message is to be used to transmit Track information (basically a list of previous position fixes) 
      # which is often displayed on the plotter or map screen of the unit.  The first field in this message 
      # is the Latitude, followed by N or S.  The next field is the Longitude followed by E or W.  The next 
      # field is the altitude followed by “F” for feet or “M” for meters.  The next field is 
      # the UTC time of the fix.  The next field consists of a status letter of “A” to indicated that 
      # the data is valid, or “V” to indicate that the data is not valid.  The last character field is 
      # the name of the track, for those units that support named tracks.  The last field contains the UTC date 
      # of the fix.  Note that this field is (and its preceding comma) is only produced by the unit when the 
      # command PMGNCMD,TRACK,2 is given.  It is not present when a simple command of PMGNCMD,TRACK is issued.

      #NOTE: The Latitude and Longitude Fields are shown as having two decimal
      # places. As many additional decimal places may be added as long as the total
      # length of the message does not exceed 82 bytes.
