module GPX

   # In GPX, a single Track can hold multiple Segments, each of which hold
   # multiple points (in this library, those points are instances of
   # TrackPoint).  Each instance of this class has its own meta-data, including
   # low point, high point, and distance.  Of course, each track references an
   # array of the segments that copmrise it, but additionally each track holds
   # a reference to all of its points as one big array called "points".
