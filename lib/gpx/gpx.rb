module GPX
  VERSION = "0.7"

  # A common base class which provides a useful initializer method to many
  # class in the GPX library.
  class Base

	# This initializer can take an XML::Node and scrape out any text
	# elements with the names given in the "text_elements" array.  Each
	# element found underneath "parent" with a name in "text_elements" causes
	# an attribute to be initialized on the instance.  This means you don't
	# have to pick out individual text elements in each initializer of each
	# class (Route, TrackPoint, Track, etc).  Just pass an array of possible
	# attributes to this method.  
	def instantiate_with_text_elements(parent, text_elements)

		child_xpath = "//#{el}"
